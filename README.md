# News Tab

A Chrome extension that displays the latest headlines on your New Tab page.

# Development

Clone this repository, `cd` into it, and run `yarn install` to install the dependencies.

To see the Chrome extension in action on your local browser, follow these steps:
1. Make sure you have set up the required environment variables (see below).
2. Run the command `yarn build` to create a production build.
3. Go to `chrome://extensions` and enable _Developer Mode_. Click on `Load Unpacked`. This will bring up the file browser.
4. Find the `build/` directory of this app and select it.
5. Now, whenever you open a new tab, you should be able to see the latest headlines!

## Environment Variables

Grab your free API key from [News API](https://newsapi.org). Add the following line to your `.env` file:

```
API_KEY=<YOUR API KEY HERE>

Additionally, create a `.env.production` file for the production environment and add the following line:

```
INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false

Inline scripts are blocked by most browsers (see [Content Security Policy](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/contentSecurityPolicy)), so this variable will help bypass this restriction by disabling scripts being added inline by react-scripts.
